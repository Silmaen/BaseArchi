## Board Arduino MKR wifi 1010

The easiest entry point to basic IoT and pico-network application design.

Whether you are looking at building a sensor network connected to 
your office or home router, or if you want to create a Bluetooth® 
Low Energy device sending data to a cellphone, the MKR WiFi 1010 
is your one-stop-solution for many of the basic IoT application scenarios.

The MKR WiFi 1010 is a great choice for any beginner, maker or professional
to get started with Internet of Things (IoT). Using the popular Arm® 
Cortex®-M0 32-bit SAMD21 processor, it also features the and the ECC508 
crypto-chip for security. The board is part of the MKR family, where you 
can choose from a large variety of shields to build projects out of the 
box with minimal effort!
