## Board Arduino MICRO

The Micro is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega32U4, developed in conjunction with Adafruit. 
It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 7 can be used as PWM outputs and 12 as analog inputs), 
a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a micro USB connection, an ICSP header, and a reset button. 
It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer 
with a micro USB cable to get started. It has a form factor that enables it to be easily 
placed on a breadboard. The Micro board is similar to the Arduino Leonardo in that the 
ATmega32U4 has built-in USB communication, eliminating the need for a secondary processor. 
This allows the Micro to appear to a connected computer as a mouse and keyboard, 
in addition to a virtual (CDC) serial / COM port.
